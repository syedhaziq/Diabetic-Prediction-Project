# Diabetic-Prediction-Project (Microsoft Course Project)

<ul>
  <li> The purpose of this project was to predict whether a person has diabetes or not given some sort of parameters.</li>
  <li> We explore the diabetic patient's dataset made available by Microsoft specifically for this project.</li>
  <li> Explore the dataset, with a plot of different variables against the target variable to see how they are related to each other.</li>
  <li> Next, we plot the histogram of the numeric variables to see how they are distributed within the data.</li>
<li>Next, we remove the outlier from the data, which can affect our model's prediction.</li>
<li>We split the data into "Train/Test" to train our model.</li>
<li>The model we have used in this project is pretty simple, Logistic Regression.</li>
<li>We also plot the confusion metric along with the ROC curve just to see if the model is not predicting randomly.</li>
</ul>
