# Diabetic-Prediction-Project

<ul>
  <li> The purpose of this project was to predict wheather a person have a diabetise or not given some sort of parameters. </li>
  <li> We explore the daibetic patients dataset made available by Microsoft specifically for this project. </li>
  <li> Explore the dataset, with a plot of different variable against the target variable to see how they are related to eachother. </li>
  <li> Next we plot the histogram of the numeric variables to see how they are distributed within the data. </li>
  <li> Next we remove the outlier from the data, which can effect our model's prediction. </li>
  <li> We split the data into "Train/Test" to train our model. </li>
  <li> The model we have use in this project is pretty simple, Logistic Regression. </li>
  <li> We also plot the confusion metric along with ROC curve just to see the model is not predicting randomly. </li>
</ul>
